# Project Title
Tracker

## Overview

Tracker provides users with personalized song suggestions based on their favorite tracks.

### Problem

Many music streaming platforms offer recommendation systems based on genres or popularity, but they don't always find songs that the user
already discovered. Tracker aims to address this by providing songs recommendations using AI and blacklisting songs users already know.
